Finding Support
##################################

If you have any trouble with MousePaw Media projects, we invite
you to contact us!

Supported Topics
==============================

We officially offer support for the following:

* Compiling and linking to PawLIB.

* Using PawLIB.

* Using the PawLIB Tester.

* Building and linking to MousePaw Media's ``libdeps`` repository with
  supported compilers.

We only support use of PawLIB using the supported compilers and environment
(see :ref:`setup-building-deps`).

..  NOTE:: Due to the complexities of running GCC and Clang on Microsoft
    Windows, we do not necessary offer support for that operating system.
    If you are certain that you are running a supported environment on
    Microsoft correctly, you ARE still welcome to contact us.

Questions about use of CPGF should be directed to that project instead
(`cpgf.org <http://cpgf.org/>`_).

Community support is available for all C++-related questions via the
`##c++-friendly <http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23%23c++-friendly&uio=MTY9dHJ1ZQ79>`_
chatroom on Freenode IRC.
